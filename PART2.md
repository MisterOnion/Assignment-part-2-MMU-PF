## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. Problem = Game save and load feature, the data needed to be saved requires the whole game to work as intended before input the total amout data into a text.file

solution= complete the board with zombie and pod functionality to save the game file.

2. Problem = Without using classes (OOP), coding the character attributes and its interactions can be a challenge.

solution= we only noticed this after making the board work and we were weren't sure how to implement classes  upon our code at this point without overhauling the entire game. So we left it alone

3. Problem = When the Alien move crosses the border the game ends with the title screen displayed 

solution = try to code in the zombie function and end the aliens turn and add a contingency for crossing the border, telling the user input invalid
